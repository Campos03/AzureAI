    "The service provides summarization solutions for three types of genre: plain texts, conversations, and native documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Text summarization** only accepts plain text blocks. \n",
    "* **Conversation summarization** accepts conversational input, including various speech audio signals. \n",
    "* **Native document summarization** accepts documents in their native formats, such as Word, PDF, or plain text\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key features for text summarization**\n",
    "Text summarization uses natural language processing techniques to generate a summary for plain texts, which can be from a document, conversation, or any texts. There are two approaches of summarization this API provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Extractive summarization**: Produces a summary by extracting salient sentences within the source text, together the positioning information of these sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - *Multiple extracted sentences*: These sentences collectively convey the main idea of the input text. They're original sentences extracted from the input text content.\n",
    "    - *Rank score*: The rank score indicates how relevant a sentence is to the main topic. Text summarization ranks extracted sentences, and you can determine whether they're returned in the order they appear, or according to their rank. For example, if you request a three-sentence summary extractive summarization returns the three highest scored sentences.\n",
    "    - *Positional information*: The start position and length of extracted sentences.\n",
    "    - *Abstractive summarization*: Generates a summary with concise, coherent sentences or words that aren't verbatim extract sentences from the original source.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Summary texts**: Abstractive summarization returns a summary for each contextual input range. A long input can be segmented so multiple groups of summary texts can be returned with their contextual input range.\n",
    "    - *Contextual input range*: The range within the input that was used to generate the summary text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supported Documents**\n",
    "* Text\t.txt\tAn unformatted text document.\n",
    "* Adobe PDF\t.pdf\tA portable document file formatted document.\n",
    "* Microsoft Word\t.docx\tA Microsoft Word document file."

As the sun heats the forest, water vapor is lifted, forming cumulus clouds when humid air encounters cooler air above. These formations, known as cloud streets, align with wind direction, generally appearing as straight lines but can also follow the patterns of high-pressure systems, as seen in the image. The visualization of wind through cloud patterns provides a unique insight into atmospheric movements that are otherwise invisible to the naked eye. This image serves as a proxy to understand the dynamics of wind in the region, highlighting the interaction between sunlight, humidity, and air masses.

Despite their inaccessibility, these volcanoes frequently erupt, often going undetected in natural-color imagery due to the prevalent clouds and ice. However, satellite technology, such as the Aqua satellite, can overcome this by using infrared imagery to differentiate volcanic ash plumes from ice clouds, revealing distinct white plumes in the South Atlantic Ocean. These eruptions, even when small, influence local weather patterns by contributing aerosols that serve as nuclei for cloud droplet formation. This insight highlights the importance of satellite monitoring in understanding volcanic impacts in such inaccessible regions.
