    "\n",
    "The service provides summarization solutions for three types of genre: plain texts, conversations, and native documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Text summarization** only accepts plain text blocks. \n",
    "* **Conversation summarization** accepts conversational input, including various speech audio signals. \n",
    "* **Native document summarization** accepts documents in their native formats, such as Word, PDF, or plain text\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key features for text summarization**\n",
    "Text summarization uses natural language processing techniques to generate a summary for plain texts, which can be from a document, conversation, or any texts. There are two approaches of summarization this API provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Extractive summarization**: Produces a summary by extracting salient sentences within the source text, together the positioning information of these sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - *Multiple extracted sentences*: These sentences collectively convey the main idea of the input text. They're original sentences extracted from the input text content.\n",
    "    - *Rank score*: The rank score indicates how relevant a sentence is to the main topic. Text summarization ranks extracted sentences, and you can determine whether they're returned in the order they appear, or according to their rank. For example, if you request a three-sentence summary extractive summarization returns the three highest scored sentences.\n",
    "    - *Positional information*: The start position and length of extracted sentences.\n",
    "    - *Abstractive summarization*: Generates a summary with concise, coherent sentences or words that aren't verbatim extract sentences from the original source.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Summary texts**: Abstractive summarization returns a summary for each contextual input range. A long input can be segmented so multiple groups of summary texts can be returned with their contextual input range.\n",
    "    - *Contextual input range*: The range within the input that was used to generate the summary text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supported Documents**\n",
    "* Text\t.txt\tAn unformatted text document.\n",
    "* Adobe PDF\t.pdf\tA portable document file formatted document.\n",
    "* Microsoft Word\t.docx\tA Microsoft Word document file."
