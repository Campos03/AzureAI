    "\n",
    "The service provides summarization solutions for three types of genre: plain texts, conversations, and native documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Text summarization** only accepts plain text blocks. \n",
    "* **Conversation summarization** accepts conversational input, including various speech audio signals. \n",
    "* **Native document summarization** accepts documents in their native formats, such as Word, PDF, or plain text\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key features for text summarization**\n",
    "Conversation summarization supports the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Recap**: Summarizes a conversation into a brief paragraph.\n",
    "* **Issue/resolution summarization**: Call center specific features that give a summary of issues and resolutions in conversations between customer-service agents and your customers.\n",
    "* **Chapter title summarization**: Segments a conversation into chapters based on the topics discussed in the conversation, and gives suggested chapter titles of the input conversation.\n",
    "* **Narrative summarization**: Generates detail call notes, meeting notes or chat summaries of the input conversation."
