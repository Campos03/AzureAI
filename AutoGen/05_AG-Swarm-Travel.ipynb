    "## AutoGen Swarm - Travel Scenario\n",
    "Swarm implements a team in which agents can hand off task to other agents based on their capabilities. It is a multi-agent design pattern first introduced by OpenAI in an experimental project. The key idea is to let agent delegate tasks to other agents using a special tool call, while all agents share the same message context. This enables agents to make local decisions about task planning, rather than relying on a central orchestrator such as in SelectorGroupChat.\n",
    "\n",
    "The speaker agent is selected based on the most recent HandoffMessage message in the context. This naturally requires each agent in the team to be able to generate HandoffMessage to signal which other agents that it hands off to.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, this is how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each agent has the ability to generate HandoffMessage to signal which other agents it can hand off to. For AssistantAgent, this means setting the handoffs argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When the team starts on a task, the first speaker agents operate on the task and make locallized decision about whether to hand off and to whom.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When an agent generates a HandoffMessage, the receiving agent takes over the task with the same message context.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The process continues until a termination condition is met."
