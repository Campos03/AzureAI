      "\n",
      "DataAssistant: Answer questions about data\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n",
      "   - The request is about identifying the top 10 years with the most sightings.\n",
      "   - There is mention of a \"date column,\" which implies that there is a dataset with a column labeled as such.\n",
      "   - The task involves creating a column chart with sightings on the Y-axis and years on the X-axis, sorted in descending order of sightings.\n",
      "   - The output should be saved as a PNG file, and the value of each year’s sightings should be displayed on top of each bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n",
      "   - None specifically mentioned in the request. Any additional information needed would depend on the actual dataset which should contain dates or sightings data.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n",
      "   - From the dataset, the years need to be extracted from the date column.\n",
      "   - The number of sightings per year needs to be calculated, followed by identifying the top 10 years with the highest number of sightings.\n",
      "   - The values for the column chart, where each bar represents a year and its corresponding number of sightings, need to be derived.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n",
      "   - The request seems to imply that the necessary data is already available in a structured format (e.g., a spreadsheet or database).\n",
      "   - The term “sightings” likely refers to a specific phenomenon or event being tracked, but this detail is not explicitly provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Extract Date Information**: Use the dataset provided to extract the \"date\" column. This will be the initial step to access the years for analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Derive Sightings by Year**: Transform the \"date\" column to extract the year for each entry. Count the number of sightings for each year.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Identify Top 10 Years**: Once the yearly sightings are counted, sort these in descending order and identify the top 10 years with the most sightings.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Create Visualization**: Use a plotting library to create a column chart with the identified top 10 years. The X-axis will represent the years and the Y-axis will represent the number of sightings. Ensure the chart is sorted by descending order of sightings.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Annotate Chart**: Add the value of sightings on top of each bar in the chart for clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Save Chart as PNG**: Export and save the generated column chart as a PNG file to meet the request requirements. \n",
      "\n",
      "The plan focuses on leveraging data analysis and visualization skills, which aligns well with the expertise of a data assistant.\n",
