      "\n",
      "Follow these steps to set up the BaseCamp Folding Table:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 1: Unfolding the Table\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Remove the table and legs from the carrying bag.\n",
      "2. Unfold the table by gently pulling the sides apart.\n",
      "3. Ensure that the table locks into place securely.\n",

      "#### Step 2: Attaching the Legs\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Locate the designated leg attachment points on the underside of the table.\n",
      "2. Insert the legs into the attachment points until they click into place.\n",
      "3. Ensure that the legs are fully extended and locked securely.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 3: Adjusting the Table Height (if applicable)\n",
      "\n",
      "1. If your BaseCamp Folding Table has adjustable height settings, locate the height\n",
      "adjustment mechanism.\n",
      "2. Adjust the table height to your desired position.\n",
      "\n",
      "\f3. Ensure that the height adjustment mechanism is locked securely.\n",

      "2. Press the leg release buttons or mechanisms to unlock the legs.\n",
      "3. Gently pull the legs out of the attachment points.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 2: Folding the Table\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Collapse the table by folding the sides towards the center.\n",
      "2. Ensure that the table folds flat and the locking mechanisms engage.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 3: Storing the Table\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Clean the table surface if necessary.\n",
      "2. Place the folded table into the carrying bag.\n",
      "3. Ensure that the bag is securely closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Cleaning and Maintenance\n",
      "\n",
      "To keep your BaseCamp Folding Table in good condition, follow these cleaning and\n",
