Rainbows are formed by \\n\\nrefraction and reflection; glories are formed by backward diffraction. From the ground or from an airplane, glories appear as circular \\n\\nrings of color. In this image, however, the glory is stretched vertically because of how the imager scans the surface in swaths.\\n\\nNote, too, the swirling von Kármán vortices visible to the right of the glory.

Due to their remote location, these volcanoes  \\n\\nare some of the least studied in the world, though satellites often catch them erupting. \\n\\nThe combination of clouds and ice at these latitudes can make it difficult to see plumes of volcanic ash in natural-color imagery. \\n\\nBut using portions of the electromagnetic spectrum that are typically invisible to the naked eye (such as infrared) enables satellites \\n\\nto distinguish ice from ash and clouds. The Aqua satellite captured this false-color image in September 2016. Note the three bright \\n\\nwhite plumes running down the middle third of the page; they are warmer and brighter in infrared than the cooler ice clouds (teal) \\n\\naround them.\\n\\nResearchers have learned that even small eruptions like this can affect cloud cover and weather. The tiny solid and liquid particles  \\n\\nin the plume (aerosols) act as seeds for the formation of cloud droplets.=================\\nTITLE: page-11.pdf, CONTENT: A\\nT\\n\\nM\\nO\\n\\nS\\nP\\n\\nH\\nE\\n\\nR\\nE\\n\\nE\\nA\\n\\nR\\nT\\n\\nH\\n\\n4\\n\\nCurving Cloud Streets\\nBrazil and Bolivia  \\n\\nTo the human eye, the wind is invisible.

As sunlight warms the forest in the morning, water vapor rises on columns of heated air. When that \\n\\nhumid air runs into a cooler, more stable air mass above, it condenses into fluffy cumulus clouds. \\n\\nCumulus cloud streets often trace the direction, and sometimes the intensity, of winds—lining up parallel to the direction of the wind. \\n\\nUsually this means a straight line, but clouds can also line up along the concentric, curved lines of high-pressure weather systems, \\n\\nas they did here.=================\\nTITLE: page-35.pdf, CONTENT: A\\nT\\n\\nM\\nO\\n\\nS\\nP\\n\\nH\\nE\\n\\nR\\nE\\n\\nE\\nA\\n\\nR\\nT\\n\\nH\\n\\n28\\n\\nFour Mountains Stand Out\\nPacific Ocean\\n\\nThey are called the Islands of the Four Mountains.
