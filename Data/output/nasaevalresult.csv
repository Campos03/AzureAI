What happen in Amazon rainforest with clouds and wind?,"- In the Amazon rainforest, water vapor rises from the forest as the sunlight warms it in the morning, and then condenses into cumulus clouds when it meets a cooler, stable air mass above (source: page-11.pdf).
- These cumulus clouds often form in lines, called cloud streets, which trace the direction and sometimes the intensity of the winds, usually aligning parallel to the wind direction (source: page-11.pdf).

Curving Cloud Streets
Brazil and Bolivia  

To the human eye, the wind is invisible. It can only be visualized by proxy, by its expressions in other phenomena like blowing leaves, 

airborne dust, white-capped waters—or the patterns of clouds.

Acquired in June 2014 by the Aqua satellite, this image shows a broad swath of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil and Bolivia as it 

appeared in the early afternoon. As sunlight warms the forest in the morning, water vapor rises on columns of heated air. When that 

humid air runs into a cooler, more stable air mass above, it condenses into fluffy cumulus clouds. 

Cumulus cloud streets often trace the direction, and sometimes the intensity, of winds—lining up parallel to the direction of the wind. 

Usually this means a straight line, but clouds can also line up along the concentric, curved lines of high-pressure weather systems, 

as they did here.=================

Making Tracks
Pacific Ocean

Ships steaming across the Pacific Ocean left this cluster of bright cloud trails lingering in the atmosphere in February 2012. The 

narrow clouds, known as ship tracks, form when water vapor condenses around tiny particles of pollution from ship exhaust. The 

crisscrossing clouds off the coast of California stretched for many hundreds of kilometers from end to end. The narrow ends of the 

clouds are youngest, while the broader, wavier ends are older.

Some of the pollution particles generated by ships (especially sulfates) are soluble in water and can serve as the seeds around which 

cloud droplets form. Clouds infused with ship exhaust have more and smaller droplets than unpolluted clouds. As a result, light 

hitting the ship tracks scatters in many directions, often making them appear brighter than other types of marine clouds, which are 

usually seeded by larger, naturally occurring particles like sea salt.=================

Filling the Valleys
Peru

The valleys along Peru’s southern coast are among the deepest on Earth. They are also frequently filled with clouds. In July 2015, 

Landsat 8 captured this view of the cloud-filled canyons through which the Yauca and Acarí rivers empty into the Pacific Ocean.

You can’t see it, but the Pacific lies below the clouds on the lower left. The clouds are marine stratocumulus—a type of low-level  

cloud so close to the surface that it is essentially fog. Such clouds are a persistent feature off the coast of Peru and Chile, 

developing most often during the winter and early spring. On some occasions, prevailing winds can push the clouds inland.  

Because the marine clouds are low, they are easily blocked by coastal mountains and hills, such as the Andes. But in areas where 

low valleys open to the ocean, the clouds move inland.","In the Amazon rainforest, as sunlight warms the forest in the morning, water vapor rises on columns of heated air.

What atmospheric phenomenon is depicted in the Landsat 8 image from August 2016 off the coast of Mauritania?,"The atmospheric phenomenon depicted in the Landsat 8 image from August 2016 off the coast of Mauritania is a wave structure in the atmosphere known as an undular bore or solitary wave.

The interaction produces a wave of air, with the winds pushing this wave ahead like a bow wave moving ahead of a boat, favorable for cloud formation in some parts of the waves. Dust blowing from Africa appears to ride these waves, but it likely has little to do with the cloud pattern observed.

Four Mountains Stand Out
Pacific Ocean

They are called the Islands of the Four Mountains. Part of the Aleutian Island chain, these peaks are actually the upper slopes of 

volcanoes rising from the seafloor: Carlisle, Cleveland, Herbert, and Tana. Standing in one of the most remote reaches of the world, 

these volcanoes have scarcely been studied. Satellite sensing makes that easier, as this Landsat 8 image from June 2013 shows.

Herbert Island (right) is dominated by a symmetrical stratovolcano that stands in its center. The remote island has scarcely been 

studied, and there are no records of eruptions there. The 2-kilometer-wide summit caldera include a lake of meltwater, remnants of 

the snow that covers the peak for most of the year. The straight-down (nadir) satellite view can make it difficult to determine which 

part of the landscape stands taller than the other, a phenomenon known as relief inversion.

On the next page, you can see how a layer of low clouds and fog obscures the lower elevations of the islands and the sea surface. 

But these clouds also hint at the complicated airflow patterns around and through the islands.=================

Lofted Over Land
Madagascar

Along the muddy Mania River, midday clouds form over the forested land but not the water. In the tropical rainforests of Madagascar, 

there is ample moisture for cloud formation. Sunlight heats the land all day, warming that moist air and causing it to rise high into the 

atmosphere until it cools and condenses into water droplets. Clouds generally form where air is ascending (over land in this case), 

but not where it is descending (over the river).

A Glorious View
Pacific Ocean

A layer of stratocumulus clouds over the Pacific Ocean serves as the backdrop for this rainbow-like phenomenon known as a glory. 

Glories form when water droplets within clouds scatter sunlight back toward a source of illumination (in this case, the Sun). 

Although glories may look similar to rainbows, the way light is scattered to produce them is different. Rainbows are formed by 

refraction and reflection; glories are formed by backward diffraction. From the ground or from an airplane, glories appear as circular 

rings of color. In this image, however, the glory is stretched vertically because of how the imager scans the surface in swaths.

Note, too, the swirling von Kármán vortices visible to the right of the glory. The alternating rows of vortices form as air masses run 

into an obstacle—the island of Guadalupe—and form a wake behind it.=================

Bering Streets
Arctic Ocean

Winds from the northeast pushed sea ice southward and formed cloud streets—parallel rows of clouds—over the Bering Strait in 

January 2010. The easternmost reaches of Russia, blanketed in snow and ice, appear in the upper left. To the east, sea ice spans 

the Bering Strait. Along the southern edge of the ice, wavy tendrils of newly formed, thin sea ice predominate.

The cloud streets run in the direction of the northerly wind that helps form them. When wind blows out from a cold surface like sea 

ice over the warmer, moister air near the open ocean, cylinders of spinning air may develop. Clouds form along the upward cycle in 

the cylinders, where air is rising, and skies remain clear along the downward cycle, where air is falling. The cloud streets run toward 

the southwest in this image from the Terra satellite.=================

Punching Holes in the Sky
United States

In December 2009, the Landsat 5 satellite observed this extraordinary example of “hole-punch clouds” over West Virginia.  

This strange phenomenon results from a combination of cold temperatures, air traffic, and atmospheric instability.

If you were to look from below, it would appear as if part of the cloud were falling out of the sky. As it turns out, that is actually what 

is happening. The clouds are initially composed of liquid drops at a super-cooled temperature below 0° Celsius. As an airplane 

passes through a cloud, particles in the exhaust can create a disturbance that triggers freezing. Ice particles then quickly grow at the 

expense of water droplets. Eventually, the ice crystals in these patches of clouds grow large enough that they literally fall out of the 

sky, earning hole-punch clouds their alternate name: “fallstreak holes.”

In this false-color image, pink and faint blue areas are typical water-rich clouds, and bright cyan areas are ice clouds.  

The hole-punch areas appear dark around the ice clouds.=================

Holuhraun Lava Field
Iceland

As an island in the moist, turbulent North Atlantic, Iceland is often shrouded in clouds and difficult to observe from space. In 2014, 

the island started making some of its own cloud cover, as the Earth split open between the Bárðarbunga and Askja volcanoes and 

spewed lava and hot gas. 

Landsat 8 captured this view of the eruption in September 2014. The false-color image combines shortwave infrared, near-infrared, 

and green light. Ice and the plume of steam and sulfur dioxide appear cyan and bright blue, while liquid water is navy blue. Bare or 

rocky ground around the Holuhraun lava field appears in shades of green or brown, and fresh lava is bright orange. Offshore clouds 

appear in bright cyan.

Infrared imagery can help scientists estimate the rate at which lava is pouring out of Earth, as well as the sulfur dioxide content of 

the plume. It also helps them pinpoint lava flows and model how the eruption evolved.=================

A Glorious View
Pacific Ocean

A layer of stratocumulus clouds over the Pacific Ocean serves as the backdrop for this rainbow-like phenomenon known as a glory. 

Glories form when water droplets within clouds scatter sunlight back toward a source of illumination (in this case, the Sun). 

Although glories may look similar to rainbows, the way light is scattered to produce them is different. Rainbows are formed by 

refraction and reflection; glories are formed by backward diffraction. From the ground or from an airplane, glories appear as circular 

rings of color. In this image, however, the glory is stretched vertically because of how the imager scans the surface in swaths.

Note, too, the swirling von Kármán vortices visible to the right of the glory. The alternating rows of vortices form as air masses run 

into an obstacle—the island of Guadalupe—and form a wake behind it.=================

of a 4.5-billion-year-old planet where there is always something 

new to see. They tell a story of land, wind, water, ice, and air

Making Tracks
Pacific Ocean

Ships steaming across the Pacific Ocean left this cluster of bright cloud trails lingering in the atmosphere in February 2012. The 

narrow clouds, known as ship tracks, form when water vapor condenses around tiny particles of pollution from ship exhaust. The 

crisscrossing clouds off the coast of California stretched for many hundreds of kilometers from end to end. The narrow ends of the 

clouds are youngest, while the broader, wavier ends are older.

Some of the pollution particles generated by ships (especially sulfates) are soluble in water and can serve as the seeds around which 

cloud droplets form. Clouds infused with ship exhaust have more and smaller droplets than unpolluted clouds. As a result, light 

hitting the ship tracks scatters in many directions, often making them appear brighter than other types of marine clouds, which are 

usually seeded by larger, naturally occurring particles like sea salt.","Glories and von Kármán vortices over the Pacific Ocean illustrate the Earth's interaction with the Sun in distinct ways. Glories form when water droplets within clouds scatter sunlight back toward the Sun, creating circular rings of color through backward diffraction. This phenomenon highlights the intricate ways in which sunlight interacts with atmospheric particles. On the other hand, von Kármán vortices are formed as air masses encounter an obstacle, such as the island of Guadalupe, and create alternating rows of vortices in the wake.

Foreword

of all celestial bodies within reach or view, as far as we can 

see, out to the edge, the most wonderful and marvelous and 

mysterious is turning out to be our own planet earth. There is 

nothing to match it anywhere, not yet anyway. 

—Lewis Thomas 

Sixty years ago, with the launch of Explorer 1, NASA made 

its first observations of Earth from space. Fifty years ago, 

astronauts left Earth orbit for the first time and looked back 

at our “blue marble.” All of these years later, as we send 

spacecraft and point our telescopes past the outer edges of  

the solar system, as we study our planetary neighbors and  

our Sun in exquisite detail, there remains much to see and 

explore at home.

We are still just getting to know Earth through the tools of 

science. For centuries, painters, poets, philosophers, and 

photographers have sought to teach us something about our 

home through their art.=================

The astonishing thing about the Earth…  

is that it is alive.... Aloft, floating free 

beneath the moist, gleaming membrane 

of bright blue sky, is the rising Earth, the 

only exuberant thing in this part of the 

cosmos…. It has the organized,  

self-contained look of a live creature,  

full of information, marvelously skilled  

in handling the Sun.

The Lives of a Cell=================
TITLE: page-8.pdf, CONTENT: This book stands at an intersection of science and art. From 

its origins, NASA has studied our planet in novel ways, using 

ingenious tools to study physical processes at work—from 

beneath the crust to the edge of the atmosphere. We look at it 

in macrocosm and microcosm, from the flow of one mountain 

stream to the flow of jet streams. Most of all, we look at Earth 

as a system, examining the cycles and processes—the water 

cycle, the carbon cycle, ocean circulation, the movement of 

heat—that interact and influence each other in a complex, 

dynamic dance across seasons and decades.

We measure particles, gases, energy, and fluids moving in, on, 

and around Earth. And like artists, we study the light—how it 

bounces, reflects, refracts, and gets absorbed and changed. 

Understanding the light and the pictures it composes is no 

small feat, given the rivers of air and gas moving between our 

satellite eyes and the planet below.

For all of the dynamism and detail we can observe from orbit, 

sometimes it is worth stepping back and simply admiring Earth. 

It is a beautiful, awe-inspiring place, and it is the only world 

most of us will ever know.

NASA has a unique vantage point for observing the beauty and 

wonder of Earth and for making sense of it. Looking back from 

space, astronaut Edgar Mitchell once called Earth “a sparkling 

blue and white jewel,” and it does dazzle the eye. The planet’s 

palette of colors and textures and shapes—far more than just 

blues and whites—are spread across the pages of this book.

of a 4.5-billion-year-old planet where there is always something

Filling the Valleys
Peru

The valleys along Peru’s southern coast are among the deepest on Earth. They are also frequently filled with clouds. In July 2015, 

Landsat 8 captured this view of the cloud-filled canyons through which the Yauca and Acarí rivers empty into the Pacific Ocean.

You can’t see it, but the Pacific lies below the clouds on the lower left. The clouds are marine stratocumulus—a type of low-level  

cloud so close to the surface that it is essentially fog. Such clouds are a persistent feature off the coast of Peru and Chile, 

developing most often during the winter and early spring. On some occasions, prevailing winds can push the clouds inland.  

Because the marine clouds are low, they are easily blocked by coastal mountains and hills, such as the Andes. But in areas where 

low valleys open to the ocean, the clouds move inland.","Glories and von Kármán vortices over the Pacific Ocean illustrate unique atmospheric phenomena observed on Earth.
