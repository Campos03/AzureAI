What does the Aqua satellite image reveal about the Amazon rainforest in Brazil and Bolivia?,"The Aqua satellite image reveals the following about the Amazon rainforest in Brazil and Bolivia:

- The image was taken in June 2014 in the early afternoon.
- It shows cumulus clouds forming over the Amazon rainforest.
- These clouds are a result of water vapor rising on columns of heated air as sunlight warms the forest.
- The humid air condenses into cumulus clouds when it hits a cooler, more stable air mass above.
- The cumulus clouds arrange themselves in ""cloud streets"" which align parallel to the direction of the wind, sometimes showing the direction and intensity of wind.
- In this particular instance, the clouds line up along the curved lines of high-pressure weather systems.

Curving Cloud Streets
Brazil and Bolivia  

To the human eye, the wind is invisible. It can only be visualized by proxy, by its expressions in other phenomena like blowing leaves, 

airborne dust, white-capped waters—or the patterns of clouds.

Acquired in June 2014 by the Aqua satellite, this image shows a broad swath of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil and Bolivia as it 

appeared in the early afternoon. As sunlight warms the forest in the morning, water vapor rises on columns of heated air. When that 

humid air runs into a cooler, more stable air mass above, it condenses into fluffy cumulus clouds. 

Cumulus cloud streets often trace the direction, and sometimes the intensity, of winds—lining up parallel to the direction of the wind. 

Usually this means a straight line, but clouds can also line up along the concentric, curved lines of high-pressure weather systems, 

as they did here.=================

A Trio of Plumes
South Atlantic Ocean

The uninhabited South Sandwich Islands include several active stratovolcanoes. Due to their remote location, these volcanoes  

are some of the least studied in the world, though satellites often catch them erupting. 

The combination of clouds and ice at these latitudes can make it difficult to see plumes of volcanic ash in natural-color imagery. 

But using portions of the electromagnetic spectrum that are typically invisible to the naked eye (such as infrared) enables satellites 

to distinguish ice from ash and clouds. The Aqua satellite captured this false-color image in September 2016. Note the three bright 

white plumes running down the middle third of the page; they are warmer and brighter in infrared than the cooler ice clouds (teal) 

around them.

Researchers have learned that even small eruptions like this can affect cloud cover and weather. The tiny solid and liquid particles  

in the plume (aerosols) act as seeds for the formation of cloud droplets.=================

A Glorious View
Pacific Ocean

A layer of stratocumulus clouds over the Pacific Ocean serves as the backdrop for this rainbow-like phenomenon known as a glory. 

Glories form when water droplets within clouds scatter sunlight back toward a source of illumination (in this case, the Sun). 

Although glories may look similar to rainbows, the way light is scattered to produce them is different. Rainbows are formed by 

refraction and reflection; glories are formed by backward diffraction. From the ground or from an airplane, glories appear as circular 

rings of color. In this image, however, the glory is stretched vertically because of how the imager scans the surface in swaths.

Note, too, the swirling von Kármán vortices visible to the right of the glory. The alternating rows of vortices form as air masses run 

into an obstacle—the island of Guadalupe—and form a wake behind it.","The Aqua satellite image, acquired in June 2014, shows a broad swath of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil and Bolivia as it appeared in the early afternoon.

Filling the Valleys
Peru

The valleys along Peru’s southern coast are among the deepest on Earth. They are also frequently filled with clouds. In July 2015, 

Landsat 8 captured this view of the cloud-filled canyons through which the Yauca and Acarí rivers empty into the Pacific Ocean.

You can’t see it, but the Pacific lies below the clouds on the lower left. The clouds are marine stratocumulus—a type of low-level  

cloud so close to the surface that it is essentially fog. Such clouds are a persistent feature off the coast of Peru and Chile, 

developing most often during the winter and early spring. On some occasions, prevailing winds can push the clouds inland.  

Because the marine clouds are low, they are easily blocked by coastal mountains and hills, such as the Andes. But in areas where 

low valleys open to the ocean, the clouds move inland.=================

Four Mountains Stand Out
Pacific Ocean

They are called the Islands of the Four Mountains. Part of the Aleutian Island chain, these peaks are actually the upper slopes of 

volcanoes rising from the seafloor: Carlisle, Cleveland, Herbert, and Tana. Standing in one of the most remote reaches of the world, 

these volcanoes have scarcely been studied. Satellite sensing makes that easier, as this Landsat 8 image from June 2013 shows.

Herbert Island (right) is dominated by a symmetrical stratovolcano that stands in its center. The remote island has scarcely been 

studied, and there are no records of eruptions there. The 2-kilometer-wide summit caldera include a lake of meltwater, remnants of 

the snow that covers the peak for most of the year. The straight-down (nadir) satellite view can make it difficult to determine which 

part of the landscape stands taller than the other, a phenomenon known as relief inversion.

On the next page, you can see how a layer of low clouds and fog obscures the lower elevations of the islands and the sea surface. 

But these clouds also hint at the complicated airflow patterns around and through the islands.=================

Storms Stir Up Sediment
Bermuda

In October 2014, the eye of Hurricane Gonzalo passed right over Bermuda. In the process, the potent storm stirred up the sediments 

in the shallow bays and lagoons around the island, spreading a huge mass of sediment across the North Atlantic Ocean. This 

Landsat 8 image shows the area after Gonzalo passed through.

The suspended sediments were likely a combination of beach sand and carbonate sediments from around the shallows and reefs. 

Coral reefs can produce large amounts of calcium carbonate, which stays on the reef flats (where there are coralline algae that also 

produce carbonate) and builds up over time to form islands.

Storm-induced export of carbonates into the deep ocean—where they mostly dissolve—is one of the ways that the oceans naturally 

balance the addition of atmospheric carbon dioxide to ocean waters.","Landsat 8 image from August 2016 shows air masses from Africa and the Atlantic Ocean colliding off the coast of Mauritania, producing a wave structure in the atmosphere called an undular bore or solitary wave.",5,5,"The RESPONSE is fully grounded and complete, accurately conveying all essential information from the CONTEXT without introducing unsupported details or omitting critical points.",5,5,"The context chunks are highly relevant to the query and are well-ranked, with the most relevant information at the top.

Wht is the Pasific?,"The Pacific is an ocean. Here are a few specific facts:

- It lies along the coast of Peru and is connected by valleys such as those through which the Yauca and Acarí rivers flow (source: page-15.pdf).
- It is covered by marine stratocumulus clouds, especially near Peru and Chile during the winter and early spring, creating features like fog in low-lying areas (source: page-15.pdf).
- Stratocumulus clouds over it can create phenomena such as glories, which are similar to rainbows but formed by backward diffraction (source: page-17.pdf).
- The central Pacific Ocean can experience strong tropical storms, such as category 3 and 4 hurricanes (Madeline and Lester in 2016), though the Hawaiian Islands rarely take direct hits (source: page-27.pdf).

Double Trouble
Pacific Ocean

The island of Hawaii rarely takes a direct hit from a hurricane. In August 2016, two Pacific storms almost changed that.

The Suomi NPP satellite observed Hurricanes Madeline and Lester stirring up the central Pacific Ocean as category 3 and 4 storms 

while moving northwest toward the Hawaiian Islands. The tight, deep eye of category 3 Hurricane Madeline (right) appears almost 

three-dimensional even in a two-dimensional satellite view. Lester (next page) showed off an equally menacing eye. The bright 

streaks across the ocean surface are areas of sunglint, where sunlight reflected directly back at the image.

Ultimately, the storms blew just south and north of the islands without making landfall. In fact, no hurricane has made landfall on the 

Big Island since recordkeeping started in 1949. Only 15 hurricanes have passed within 200 nautical miles of the island in that time.","The Pacific lies below the clouds on the lower left, where the Yauca and Acarí rivers empty into it.",5,5,"The RESPONSE is fully grounded and complete, accurately conveying all essential information from the CONTEXT without introducing unsupported details or omitting critical points.",2,2,"The input data should get a Score of 2 because the context chunks are partially relevant to the query.

What weather phenomenon occurred in the Bering Strait in January 2010?,"In January 2010, winds from the northeast pushed sea ice southward and formed cloud streets—parallel rows of clouds—over the Bering Strait. These cloud streets were the result of winds blowing from a cold surface over the warmer, moister air near the open ocean, creating cylinders of spinning air where clouds form along the upward cycle.

Bering Streets
Arctic Ocean

Winds from the northeast pushed sea ice southward and formed cloud streets—parallel rows of clouds—over the Bering Strait in 

January 2010. The easternmost reaches of Russia, blanketed in snow and ice, appear in the upper left. To the east, sea ice spans 

the Bering Strait. Along the southern edge of the ice, wavy tendrils of newly formed, thin sea ice predominate.

The cloud streets run in the direction of the northerly wind that helps form them. When wind blows out from a cold surface like sea 

ice over the warmer, moister air near the open ocean, cylinders of spinning air may develop. Clouds form along the upward cycle in 

the cylinders, where air is rising, and skies remain clear along the downward cycle, where air is falling. The cloud streets run toward 

the southwest in this image from the Terra satellite.=================

Valley Fog
Canada

Fog is essentially a cloud lying on the ground. Like all clouds, it forms when the air reaches its dew point—the temperature at  

which an air mass is cool enough for its water vapor to condense into liquid droplets.

This false-color image shows valley fog, which is common in the Pacific Northwest of North America. On clear winter nights, the 

ground and overlying air cool off rapidly, especially at high elevations. Cold air is denser than warm air, and it sinks down into the 

valleys. The moist air in the valleys gets chilled to its dew point, and fog forms. If undisturbed by winds, such fog may persist for 

days. The Terra satellite captured this image of foggy valleys northeast of Vancouver in February 2010.=================

Teeming Life in the Strait of Georgia
Canada

In August 2016, the waters off of British Columbia turned bright green. The Strait of Georgia and nearby inlets were teeming with 

coccolithophores—a harmless type of floating plant-like organisms called phytoplankton. Coccolithophores have chalky, scale-like 

shells made of calcium carbonate. The milky-white color of those shells can brighten and discolor otherwise blue waters when the 

plankton explode in such massive blooms. 

While coccolithophore blooms occasionally occur off the west coast of Vancouver Island, few scientists could recall seeing a bloom 

like this in the strait. Research suggests that coccolithophore numbers have been increasing in recent decades even as the water 

has been growing more acidic.","In January 2010, winds from the northeast pushed sea ice southward and formed cloud streets—parallel rows of clouds—over the Bering Strait.",5,5,"The RESPONSE is fully grounded and complete, accurately conveying all essential information from the CONTEXT without introducing unsupported details or omitting critical points.",5,5,"The input data should get a high score because the most relevant context chunk is at the top of the list, fully addressing the query without introducing external knowledge or bias.",4,4,"The response fully addresses the question with accurate and complete information about the weather phenomenon that occurred in the Bering Strait in January 2010, including the formation of cloud streets and the conditions that led to it.",4,4,The response is coherent and effectively addresses the question with a logical sequence of ideas and clear connections between sentences.,4,4,"The response is well-articulated, with good control of grammar and a varied vocabulary.

Channel Country
Australia

Australia’s Channel Country is full of hundreds of channels, as the Georgina, Burke, and Hamilton rivers merge into the very broad 

floodplain of Eyre Creek. The land is flat and the drainage is poor, which encourages semi-permanent wetlands to form at the 

meeting points of the rivers.

These wide floodplains in Queensland are unique on the planet. Scientists think they are caused by the extreme variation in water 

and sediment discharges from the rivers. In many years there is no rainfall at all, and the rivers are effectively non-existent. In years 

of modest rainfall, the main channels will carry some water, sometimes spilling over into narrow water holes known as billabongs.

Every few decades, the floodplain carries extremely high discharges of water. For instance, tropical storms to the north can lead 

to great water flows that inundate the entire width of the floodplain. On such occasions, the floodplain appears as series of brown 

and green water surfaces with only tree tops indicating the location of the islands. Such is the case in this image taken from the 

International Space Station in September 2016.=================

This capability was demonstrated in a false-color image from September 2016, where the satellite captured bright white ash plumes distinct from the cooler ice clouds (source: page-13.pdf).
- **Cloud Patterns**: The Aqua satellite can visualize wind patterns by capturing the alignment of cloud streets. For example, an image from June 2014 showed cumulus clouds over the Amazon rainforest, which formed parallel lines indicating the direction and intensity of winds (source: page-11.pdf).

Summary: The Aqua satellite aids in studying atmospheric phenomena by using infrared imagery to differentiate volcanic ash from ice and clouds, and by capturing cloud formations that reveal wind patterns.","TITLE: page-13.pdf, CONTENT: A

A Trio of Plumes
South Atlantic Ocean

The uninhabited South Sandwich Islands include several active stratovolcanoes. Due to their remote location, these volcanoes  

are some of the least studied in the world, though satellites often catch them erupting. 

The combination of clouds and ice at these latitudes can make it difficult to see plumes of volcanic ash in natural-color imagery. 

But using portions of the electromagnetic spectrum that are typically invisible to the naked eye (such as infrared) enables satellites 

to distinguish ice from ash and clouds. The Aqua satellite captured this false-color image in September 2016. Note the three bright 

white plumes running down the middle third of the page; they are warmer and brighter in infrared than the cooler ice clouds (teal) 

around them.

Researchers have learned that even small eruptions like this can affect cloud cover and weather. The tiny solid and liquid particles  

in the plume (aerosols) act as seeds for the formation of cloud droplets.=================

Curving Cloud Streets
Brazil and Bolivia  

To the human eye, the wind is invisible. It can only be visualized by proxy, by its expressions in other phenomena like blowing leaves, 

airborne dust, white-capped waters—or the patterns of clouds.

Acquired in June 2014 by the Aqua satellite, this image shows a broad swath of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil and Bolivia as it 

appeared in the early afternoon. As sunlight warms the forest in the morning, water vapor rises on columns of heated air. When that 

humid air runs into a cooler, more stable air mass above, it condenses into fluffy cumulus clouds. 

Cumulus cloud streets often trace the direction, and sometimes the intensity, of winds—lining up parallel to the direction of the wind. 

Usually this means a straight line, but clouds can also line up along the concentric, curved lines of high-pressure weather systems, 

as they did here.=================

Four Mountains Stand Out
Pacific Ocean

They are called the Islands of the Four Mountains. Part of the Aleutian Island chain, these peaks are actually the upper slopes of 

volcanoes rising from the seafloor: Carlisle, Cleveland, Herbert, and Tana. Standing in one of the most remote reaches of the world, 

these volcanoes have scarcely been studied. Satellite sensing makes that easier, as this Landsat 8 image from June 2013 shows.

Herbert Island (right) is dominated by a symmetrical stratovolcano that stands in its center. The remote island has scarcely been 

studied, and there are no records of eruptions there. The 2-kilometer-wide summit caldera include a lake of meltwater, remnants of 

the snow that covers the peak for most of the year. The straight-down (nadir) satellite view can make it difficult to determine which 

part of the landscape stands taller than the other, a phenomenon known as relief inversion.

On the next page, you can see how a layer of low clouds and fog obscures the lower elevations of the islands and the sea surface. 

But these clouds also hint at the complicated airflow patterns around and through the islands.","The Aqua satellite aids in studying atmospheric phenomena by capturing images using portions of the electromagnetic spectrum that are invisible to the naked eye, such as infrared.

Foreword

of all celestial bodies within reach or view, as far as we can 

see, out to the edge, the most wonderful and marvelous and 

mysterious is turning out to be our own planet earth. There is 

nothing to match it anywhere, not yet anyway. 

—Lewis Thomas 

Sixty years ago, with the launch of Explorer 1, NASA made 

its first observations of Earth from space. Fifty years ago, 

astronauts left Earth orbit for the first time and looked back 

at our “blue marble.” All of these years later, as we send 

spacecraft and point our telescopes past the outer edges of  

the solar system, as we study our planetary neighbors and  

our Sun in exquisite detail, there remains much to see and 

explore at home.

We are still just getting to know Earth through the tools of 

science. For centuries, painters, poets, philosophers, and 

photographers have sought to teach us something about our 

home through their art.=================

blues and whites—are spread across the pages of this book.

We chose these images because they inspire. They tell a story 

of a 4.5-billion-year-old planet where there is always something 

new to see. They tell a story of land, wind, water, ice, and air 

as they can only be viewed from above. They show us that no 

matter what the human mind can imagine, no matter what the 

artist can conceive, there are few things more fantastic and 

inspiring than the world as it already is. The truth of our planet  

is just as compelling as any fiction.

We hope you enjoy this satellite view of Earth.  

It is your planet. It is NASA’s mission.

A Glorious View
Pacific Ocean

A layer of stratocumulus clouds over the Pacific Ocean serves as the backdrop for this rainbow-like phenomenon known as a glory. 

Glories form when water droplets within clouds scatter sunlight back toward a source of illumination (in this case, the Sun). 

Although glories may look similar to rainbows, the way light is scattered to produce them is different. Rainbows are formed by 

refraction and reflection; glories are formed by backward diffraction. From the ground or from an airplane, glories appear as circular 

rings of color. In this image, however, the glory is stretched vertically because of how the imager scans the surface in swaths.

Note, too, the swirling von Kármán vortices visible to the right of the glory. The alternating rows of vortices form as air masses run 

into an obstacle—the island of Guadalupe—and form a wake behind it.=================
