What does the Aqua satellite image reveal about the Amazon rainforest in Brazil and Bolivia?,"['To the human eye, the wind is invisible. It can only be visualized by proxy, by its expressions in other phenomena like blowing leaves,\n\nairborne dust, white-capped waters—or the patterns of clouds.\n\nAcquired in June 2014 by the Aqua satellite, this image shows a broad swath of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil and Bolivia as it\n\nappeared in the early afternoon. As sunlight warms the forest in the morning, water vapor rises on columns of heated air. When that\n\nhumid air runs into a cooler, more stable air mass above, it condenses into fluffy cumulus clouds.\n\nCumulus cloud streets often trace the direction, and sometimes the intensity, of winds—lining up parallel to the direction of the wind.\n\nUsually this means a straight line, but clouds can also line up along the concentric, curved lines of high-pressure weather systems,\n\nas they did here.\n\nE R E H P S O M T A\n\n4']","The Aqua satellite image, acquired in June 2014, shows a broad swath of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil and Bolivia as it appeared in the early afternoon.

What Landsat 8 show?,"['You cannot see it directly, but air masses from Africa and the Atlantic Ocean are colliding in this Landsat 8 image from August 2016.\n\nThe collision off the coast of Mauritania produces a wave structure in the atmosphere.\n\nCalled an undular bore or solitary wave, this cloud formation was created by the interaction between cool, dry air coming off the\n\ncontinent and running into warm, moist air over the ocean. The winds blowing out from the land push a wave of air ahead like a\n\nbow wave moving ahead of a boat.\n\nParts of these waves are favorable for cloud formation, while other parts are not. The dust blowing out from Africa appears to be\n\nriding these waves. Dust has been known to affect cloud growth, but it probably has little to do with the cloud pattern observed here.\n\nE R E H P S O M T A\n\n16']","Landsat 8 image from August 2016 shows air masses from Africa and the Atlantic Ocean colliding off the coast of Mauritania, producing a wave structure in the atmosphere called an undular bore or solitary wave.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
Wht is the Pasific?,"['The valleys along Peru’s southern coast are among the deepest on Earth. They are also frequently filled with clouds. In July 2015,\n\nLandsat 8 captured this view of the cloud-filled canyons through which the Yauca and Acarí rivers empty into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nYou can’t see it, but the Pacific lies below the clouds on the lower left. The clouds are marine stratocumulus—a type of low-level\n\ncloud so close to the surface that it is essentially fog. Such clouds are a persistent feature off the coast of Peru and Chile,\n\ndeveloping most often during the winter and early spring. On some occasions, prevailing winds can push the clouds inland.\n\nBecause the marine clouds are low, they are easily blocked by coastal mountains and hills, such as the Andes. But in areas where\n\nlow valleys open to the ocean, the clouds move inland.\n\nE R E H P S O M T A\n\n8']","The Pacific lies below the clouds on the lower left, where the Yauca and Acarí rivers empty into it.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
What weather phenomenon occurred in the Bering Strait in January 2010?,"['Winds from the northeast pushed sea ice southward and formed cloud streets—parallel rows of clouds—over the Bering Strait in\n\nJanuary 2010. The easternmost reaches of Russia, blanketed in snow and ice, appear in the upper left. To the east, sea ice spans\n\nthe Bering Strait. Along the southern edge of the ice, wavy tendrils of newly formed, thin sea ice predominate.\n\nThe cloud streets run in the direction of the northerly wind that helps form them. When wind blows out from a cold surface like sea\n\nice over the warmer, moister air near the open ocean, cylinders of spinning air may develop. Clouds form along the upward cycle in\n\nthe cylinders, where air is rising, and skies remain clear along the downward cycle, where air is falling. The cloud streets run toward\n\nthe southwest in this image from the Terra satellite.\n\nE R E H P S O M T A\n\n14']","In January 2010, winds from the northeast pushed sea ice southward and formed cloud streets—parallel rows of clouds—over the Bering Strait.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
Wht cn u tell me abut Hrbert Island in the Aleutian Island chain?,"['They are called the Islands of the Four Mountains. Part of the Aleutian Island chain, these peaks are actually the upper slopes of\n\nvolcanoes rising from the seafloor: Carlisle, Cleveland, Herbert, and Tana. Standing in one of the most remote reaches of the world,\n\nthese volcanoes have scarcely been studied. Satellite sensing makes that easier, as this Landsat 8 image from June 2013 shows.\n\nHerbert Island (right) is dominated by a symmetrical stratovolcano that stands in its center. The remote island has scarcely been\n\nstudied, and there are no records of eruptions there. The 2-kilometer-wide summit caldera include a lake of meltwater, remnants of\n\nthe snow that covers the peak for most of the year. The straight-down (nadir) satellite view can make it difficult to determine which\n\npart of the landscape stands taller than the other, a phenomenon known as relief inversion.\n\nOn the next page, you can see how a layer of low clouds and fog obscures the lower elevations of the islands and the sea surface.\n\nBut these clouds also hint at the complicated airflow patterns around and through the islands.\n\nE R E H P S O M T A\n\n28']","Herbert Island is dominated by a symmetrical stratovolcano that stands in its center.

How does the Aqua satellite help in studying atmospheric phenomena like volcanic plumes and cloud patterns?,"['A Trio of Plumes South Atlantic Ocean\n\nThe uninhabited South Sandwich Islands include several active stratovolcanoes. Due to their remote location, these volcanoes\n\nare some of the least studied in the world, though satellites often catch them erupting.\n\nThe combination of clouds and ice at these latitudes can make it difficult to see plumes of volcanic ash in natural-color imagery.\n\nBut using portions of the electromagnetic spectrum that are typically invisible to the naked eye (such as infrared) enables satellites\n\nto distinguish ice from ash and clouds. The Aqua satellite captured this false-color image in September 2016. Note the three bright\n\nwhite plumes running down the middle third of the page; they are warmer and brighter in infrared than the cooler ice clouds (teal)\n\naround them.\n\nResearchers have learned that even small eruptions like this can affect cloud cover and weather.
