How do air masses from Africa influence cloud formation off the coast of Mauritania?,"['You cannot see it directly, but air masses from Africa and the Atlantic Ocean are colliding in this Landsat 8 image from August 2016.\n\nThe collision off the coast of Mauritania produces a wave structure in the atmosphere.\n\nCalled an undular bore or solitary wave, this cloud formation was created by the interaction between cool, dry air coming off the\n\ncontinent and running into warm, moist air over the ocean. The winds blowing out from the land push a wave of air ahead like a\n\nbow wave moving ahead of a boat.\n\nParts of these waves are favorable for cloud formation, while other parts are not.

Wht are the cloud behaviors observed in the valleys of Peru that empty into the Pacifc Ocan?,"['The valleys along Peru’s southern coast are among the deepest on Earth. They are also frequently filled with clouds. In July 2015,\n\nLandsat 8 captured this view of the cloud-filled canyons through which the Yauca and Acarí rivers empty into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nYou can’t see it, but the Pacific lies below the clouds on the lower left. The clouds are marine stratocumulus—a type of low-level\n\ncloud so close to the surface that it is essentially fog. Such clouds are a persistent feature off the coast of Peru and Chile,\n\ndeveloping most often during the winter and early spring. On some occasions, prevailing winds can push the clouds inland.\n\nBecause the marine clouds are low, they are easily blocked by coastal mountains and hills, such as the Andes. But in areas where\n\nlow valleys open to the ocean, the clouds move inland.\n\nE R E H P S O M T A\n\n8']","The valleys along Peru’s southern coast are frequently filled with clouds, particularly marine stratocumulus clouds, which are low-level clouds that can appear similar to fog.

What happen in Bering Strait in January 2010?,"['Winds from the northeast pushed sea ice southward and formed cloud streets—parallel rows of clouds—over the Bering Strait in\n\nJanuary 2010.

Along the southern edge of the ice, wavy tendrils of newly formed, thin sea ice predominate.\n\nThe cloud streets run in the direction of the northerly wind that helps form them. When wind blows out from a cold surface like sea\n\nice over the warmer, moister air near the open ocean, cylinders of spinning air may develop.
