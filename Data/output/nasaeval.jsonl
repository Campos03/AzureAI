The \n\nnarrow clouds, known as ship tracks, form when water vapor condenses around tiny particles of pollution from ship exhaust. The \n\ncrisscrossing clouds off the coast of California stretched for many hundreds of kilometers from end to end. The narrow ends of the \n\nclouds are youngest, while the broader, wavier ends are older.\n\nSome of the pollution particles generated by ships (especially sulfates) are soluble in water and can serve as the seeds around which \n\ncloud droplets form. Clouds infused with ship exhaust have more and smaller droplets than unpolluted clouds. As a result, light \n\nhitting the ship tracks scatters in many directions, often making them appear brighter than other types of marine clouds, which are \n\nusually seeded by larger, naturally occurring particles like sea salt.=================\nTITLE: page-15.pdf, CONTENT: A\nT\n\nM\nO\n\nS\nP\n\nH\nE\n\nR\nE\n\nE\nA\n\nR\nT\n\nH\n\n8\n\nFilling the Valleys\nPeru\n\nThe valleys along Peru\u2019s southern coast are among the deepest on Earth.

The clouds are marine stratocumulus\u2014a type of low-level  \n\ncloud so close to the surface that it is essentially fog. Such clouds are a persistent feature off the coast of Peru and Chile, \n\ndeveloping most often during the winter and early spring. On some occasions, prevailing winds can push the clouds inland.  \n\nBecause the marine clouds are low, they are easily blocked by coastal mountains and hills, such as the Andes. But in areas where \n\nlow valleys open to the ocean, the clouds move inland.","ground_truth":"Glories and von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortices over the Pacific Ocean illustrate unique atmospheric phenomena observed on Earth.
