{"query":"How does the Aqua satellite contribute to our understanding of cloud formation in relation to volcanic eruptions and wind patterns in the Amazon rainforest?","response":"The Aqua satellite contributes to our understanding of cloud formation in relation to volcanic eruptions and wind patterns in the Amazon rainforest in the following ways:\n\n- **Cloud Formation and Wind Patterns**: Aqua satellite images show how cumulus clouds form when warm, humid air rises from the Amazon rainforest and meets cooler air, creating cloud streets. These clouds can be aligned with wind directions, providing insights into the prevailing wind patterns in the region (source: page-11.pdf).\n\n- **Impact of Volcanic Eruptions**: The Aqua satellite can detect volcanic ash plumes, even small eruptions, which affect cloud cover and weather.
