In the context of space exploration and scientific observation, Thomas underscores the importance of continuing to explore and understand our planet, despite the advancements in studying other celestial bodies. He reflects on the progress made since NASA's first observations of Earth from space and the astronauts' first look back at our 'blue marble,' suggesting that there remains much to learn about our home through the tools of science."}

Rainbows are formed by \n\nrefraction and reflection; glories are formed by backward diffraction. From the ground or from an airplane, glories appear as circular \n\nrings of color. In this image, however, the glory is stretched vertically because of how the imager scans the surface in swaths.\n\nNote, too, the swirling von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortices visible to the right of the glory.
