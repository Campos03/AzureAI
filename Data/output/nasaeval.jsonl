Rainbows are formed by \n\nrefraction and reflection; glories are formed by backward diffraction. From the ground or from an airplane, glories appear as circular \n\nrings of color. In this image, however, the glory is stretched vertically because of how the imager scans the surface in swaths.\n\nNote, too, the swirling von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortices visible to the right of the glory. The alternating rows of vortices form as air masses run \n\ninto an obstacle\u2014the island of Guadalupe\u2014and form a wake behind it.","ground_truth":"In August 2016, two significant atmospheric phenomena were observed: Hurricanes Madeline and Lester in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii, and an undular bore off the coast of Mauritania. The hurricanes, which were category 3 and 4 storms, stirred up the central Pacific Ocean but ultimately did not make landfall on the Hawaiian Islands. This highlights the rarity of hurricanes impacting Hawaii, as no hurricane has made landfall on the Big Island since recordkeeping began in 1949. Meanwhile, the undular bore off Mauritania was created by the collision of cool, dry air from Africa with warm, moist air over the Atlantic Ocean, resulting in a wave structure in the atmosphere. These events illustrate the complexity of Earth's physical processes, showcasing how different air masses interact and influence weather patterns across vast distances."}
