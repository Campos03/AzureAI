Cleaning Instructions - Spot clean any stains or dirt with a damp cloth or sponge. - If necessary, use a mild detergent and warm water solution for more thorough cleaning. - Rinse thoroughly and air dry completely before storage. - Avoid using harsh chemicals, bleach, or abrasive cleaners, as they may damage the fabric. Storage Guidelines - Before storing, make sure the daypack is clean and dry to prevent mold or mildew growth. - Store the daypack in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Ensure all zippers and closures are fully closed to prevent dust or debris from entering. - Avoid placing heavy objects on top of the daypack during storage. ## Caution Information 1. Do not overload the daypack beyond its recommended weight capacity. Exceeding the weight limit can strain the backpack's seams, zippers, and overall structure, leading to potential damage or discomfort. 2.
